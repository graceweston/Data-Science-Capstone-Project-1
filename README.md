Capstone Project 1: Grace, Carter, and Mackenzie

Last semester for our project proposal we wanted to focus on the quality of life in Copenhagen, Denmark and using metrics such as bike traffic, housing prices, and air quality to measure. 
However, after finishing the proposal, and taking time over break to re-evaluate, we thought it might be best to choose a differnt topic that we are more interested in. 
For our project we want to look at the NBA specifically and if home-court advantage is real. Through this research we will look at box charts spanning many seasons to see the outcome of 
the games, where they were played, and attendance. From other data sets we will gather the stadium coordinates so we can calculate distance traveled to see how that plays a factor. 
Additionally, we will look at schedules to see if there is a factor in having fresh legs for a game versus playing back-to-back, and what the outcome of the game prior was.
