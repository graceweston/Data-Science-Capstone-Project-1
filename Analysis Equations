Analysis Equations:

Home win rate overall = # of home wins/total # of home games
Away win rate overall = # of away wins/total # of away games

*Make bracket groups
  Attendance: What should the bracket sizes be?
    -> 0-14,999 (low)
    -> 15,000-17,499 (medium)
    -> 17,500-19,499 (high)
    -> >=19,500 (sellout)

  Amount of travel: Could do miles or km? How big should bracket sizes be? Maybe just keep continuous

  Time difference: 
    -> 0 hours
    -> 1 hours
    -> 2 hours
    -> 3 hours

Home Win rate by attendance = home wins in "group"/ home games in "group"
Home Win rate by travel = home wins in "group"/ home games in "group"
Home Win rate by time difference = home wins in "group"/ home games in "group"

*Conditions...
  back-to-back: rest_days==0
  rested: rest_days>1

Compare rested vs back to back games

Comparing if coming off a loss/win matters differently for home vs away teams


Log regression compared to overall with rate -> use the home win rate by... as the x variable -> find the p value to see what is statistically significant

Take into account the overall record because if a team's record is undefeated... then it will fit the log reg perfectly which isn't accurate
